# WiredTiger's GCP Extension
## 1. Introduction
This extension allows WiredTiger storage source extensions to read from and write to objects stored
in Google Cloud Storage using WiredTigerâ€™s provided internal abstraction for storing data in an
object storage service.

## 2. Building and running
This section describes how to build WiredTiger with the GCP extension enabled.

### Requirements
* CMake 3.11 or higher
* G++ 8.4 or higher
* Abseil LTS 20230125
* nlohmann_json library 3.11.2
* crc32c 1.1.2

### How to install requirements (skip this step if requirements have been met)
If the CMake version is not 3.11 or higher update CMake to 3.11 using the following.
```bash
sudo apt remove cmake
wget https://cmake.org/files/v3.11/cmake-3.11.0.tar.gz
tar xf cmake-3.11.0.tar.gz

cd cmake-3.11.0

./configure
make -j $(nproc)
sudo make install
```
Check that CMake has been updated using the following command `cmake --version`.

If cmake is not in `/usr/bin/` create a symbolic link using the following.

```bash
sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/cmake /usr/bin/cmake
```

If the G++ version is not 8.4 or higher update G++ to 8.4 using the following.

```bash
sudo apt-get install gcc-8 g++-8
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-8 20
  --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-8
```
Check that G++ has been updated using the following command `g++ --version`.

### Check Abseil exists locally
```bash
sudo find /usr/ -iname absl
# if /usr/local/lib/cmake/absl or /usr/local/include/absl is not found absl doesn't exist!

# Instructions to download Abseil if Abseil doesn't exist.
mkdir -p $HOME/Downloads/abseil-cpp && cd $HOME/Downloads/abseil-cpp

curl -sSL https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp/archive/20230125.0.tar.gz | \
  tar -xzf - --strip-components=1

mkdir cmake-out && cd cmake-out

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DABSL_BUILD_TESTING=OFF -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes ../.
  && make -j $(nproc)

cd ..
sudo cmake --build cmake-out --target install
```

### Check the nlohmann_json library exists locally
```bash
sudo find /usr/ -iname nlohmann
# if /usr/local/include/nlohmann is not found nlohmann_json ibrary doesn't exist!

# Instructions to download nlohmann_json library if nlohmann_json library doesn't exist.
mkdir -p $HOME/Downloads/json && cd $HOME/Downloads/json

curl -sSL https://github.com/nlohmann/json/archive/v3.11.2.tar.gz | \
  tar -xzf - --strip-components=1

mkdir cmake-out && cd cmake-out

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
  -DJSON_BuildTests=OFF ../. && make -j $(nproc)

cd ..
sudo cmake --build cmake-out --target install
```

### Check if crc32c exists locally
```bash
sudo find /usr/ -iname crc32c
# if /usr/local/lib/cmake/Crc32c or /usr/local/include/crc32c is not found crc32c doesn't exist!

# Instructions to download crc32c if crc32c doesn't exist.
mkdir -p $HOME/Downloads/crc32c && cd $HOME/Downloads/crc32c

curl -sSL https://github.com/google/crc32c/archive/1.1.2.tar.gz | \
  tar -xzf - --strip-components=1

mkdir cmake-out && cd cmake-out

cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=yes -DCRC32C_BUILD_TESTS=OFF
  -DCRC32C_BUILD_BENCHMARKS=OFF -DCRC32C_USE_GLOG=OFF ../. && make -j $(nproc)

cd ..
sudo cmake --build cmake-out --target install
```
### Building
There is currently only 1 way to build WiredTiger with GCP extension:
1. Letting CMake manage the GCP SDK dependency as an external project, letting it download, link
  and build the extension.

There are two CMake flags associated with the GCP extension: `ENABLE_GCP` and `IMPORT_GCP_SDK`.
* `ENABLE_GCP=1` is required to build the GCP extension.
* `IMPORT_GCP_SDK={external}` is used to set the build method.
    *   `external` tells the compiler to search for an existing system installation of the SDK.
    *    This flag should be set alongside the `ENABLE_GCP` flag.
    *    If the `IMPORT_GCP_SDK` flag is not specified, the compiler will assume a system
          installation of the SDK which will is currently not supported.
### Letting CMake manage the SDK dependency as an external project

This method configures CMake to download, compile, and install the GCP SDK while building
the GCP extension.

```bash
# Create a new directory to run the build from
$ mkdir build && cd build

# Configure and run cmake with Ninja
cmake -DENABLE_PYTHON=1 -DHAVE_UNITTEST=1 -DIMPORT_GCP_SDK=external -DENABLE_GCP=1 -G Ninja ../.
ninja
```

* The compiler flag `IMPORT_GCP_SDK` must be set to `external` for this build method.
* `ENABLE_GCP` defaults to looking for a local version, the `IMPORT_GCP_SDK` setting will
    override that default.

## 3. Development
In order to run this extension after building, the developer must have a GCP credentials file
locally with the right permissions. The path to this json file must be stored in an environment
variable called `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`. To store the environment variable type
`export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS="path/to/json/"` into the terminal.

## 4. Testing

Before running the tests set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH to tell the loader where to look for the
dynamic shared libraries that we made earlier.

```bash
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/gcp-sdk-cpp/install/lib:/usr/local/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```
### To run the tiered python tests for GCP:

```bash
# This will run all the tests in test_tiered19.py on the GCP storage source. The following command
# will run the tests from the build directory that was made earlier.
cd build
env WT_BUILDDIR=$(pwd) python3 ../test/suite/run.py -j 10 -v 4 test_tiered19
```

### To run the C unit tests for GCP:

```bash
# Once WiredTiger has been built with the GCP Extension, run the tests from the build directory
cd build
ext/storage_sources/gcp_store/test/run_gcp_unit_tests
```

To add any additional unit testing, add to the file `test_GCP_connection.cpp`, alternatively if the
developer wishes to add a new test file, add it to the `SOURCES` list in `create_test_executable()`
(in `GCP_store/test/CMakeLists.txt`).

## 5. Evergreen Testing

Currently the Evergreen testing runs both `test_tiered19.py` and the unit tests in
`test_gcp_connection.cpp`. Should a developer wish to additional tests to the extension, they would
first have to write the tests before adding it as a task to the evergreen.yml file.

Additionally, Evergreen has hidden the private key and private key id for GCP and these are stored
within the Evergreen system. Due to GCP requiring a json authentication file to authenticate the
connection, a temporary file of the json authentication file is required to be subsitituted with the
private key and private key id hidden earlier. Evergreen also has a script to install all the
dependencies that GCP requires.
